# Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

## Challenge
```
The goal of this exercise is to implement a command-line calculator which uses reverse polish
notation (RPN).
Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation in which every operator
follows all of its operands, in contrast to Polish notation (PN), which puts the operator
before its operands. It is also known as postfix notation. It does not need any
parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands.
